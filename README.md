# Your License Scares Me!
Don't worry. It should be clear by reading it but just in case it's unclear for any reason:

* If you improve the code in any way, please open-source or make a pull request.
* If you make a game with this, license it however you please. Just include a copy of the LGPL.
   * Ex: Chuck a copy of the license with the name "Shader-Stacker" in a "Licenses" folder.
* You can do whatever you want with the sample assets.
* A link back to the repo as attribution would be nice but not strictly neccisary.
